Week 7: Gene Set Testing
=======================================

# Gene Sets

Genes don't work alone, so don't analyze them like that

Gene Sets:

Gene Ontology

Kegg

Handy Gene Sets

Handy Gene Sets

Curated by Experts or found in microarray data

## Example 1: Yq11 Gene Set

Here are the Yq11 genes, are they differentially expressed more than other genes?

 | Not in gene set | In gene set
--- | --- | ---
Not differentially expressed | 8796 | 9
Differentially expressed | 11 | 4

26% of genes in gene set are differentially expressed whne on ly 0.1% are expected, however the counts are small and the chi-square approximateion is inappropriate
